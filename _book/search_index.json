The Landscape Genetics Distributed Graduate Seminar (DGS) is an international collaboration that provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary graduate training. The course draws on experts from around the world to deliver an in-depth introduction and overview of the field of landscape genetics. The course caters to students in both basic and applied ecology, conservation/population genetics, landscape ecology and conservation biology. Every other year, several hundred students, post-docs and faculty from around the world participate in this course. For more information about the course, and to sign up to be notified when registration opens, please visit the course website: Link to DGS Landscape Genetics The online book compiles the teaching materials for the optional computer lab component of the DGS Landscape Genetics. The materials included in this online resource are also included in the R package LandGenCourse available on Github.

Table of contents: in the left-side navigation bar, click on any entry to expand or collapse it. 1. Book Structure This book has weekly chapters that correspond to course modules, with three parts: a) Getting Started Review of R Skills: check whether you need to build or brush up your R skills before starting the course: Basic R Programming: introduction to R objects and functions. Prerequisite. R Graphics: learn to create figures with base R and with ggplot2. Optional. b) Basic Topics These 8 weekly modules are streamlined to build the necessary R skills and brush up statistics knowledge. Best complete these in sequence. Each module has the following components: Video: introduces the R and stats topics Interactive Tutorial: swirl course to practice R programming Worked Example: worked example by the weekly experts from the DGS Landscape Genetics course. Bonus Materials: some weeks include bonus vignettes with optional advanced topics. c) Advanced Topics These weekly modules build on the skills developed in Basic Topics. You may pick and choose from the Advanced Topics according to your interests. Each weekly modules contains: Worked Example: worked example by the weekly experts from the DGS Landscape Genetics course. Bonus Materials: some weeks include bonus vignettes with optional advanced topics. 2. Find what is relevant for you a) How to use the labs Weeks 1 - 8: Beginners: watch video do tutorial to build basic R programming skills read worked example, focus on content Intermediate: watch video check weekly tutorial functions: do tutorial to brush up? understand worked example, focus on content and code do R exercise to practice coding Advanced: check video slides: watch video to brush up on concepts? R exercise? adapt worked example to own data By Week 9: you will be at least at intermediate level if not a pro! b) Check contents Videos: Check first weekly slide, browse slides for each week Interactive tutorials: check weekly list of commands for each chapter Worked examples: check List of R Packages by Vignette; check introduction section for each worked example (or bonus vignette) 3. Course R package LandGenCourse a) How to install (or update) if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) ## Loading required package: devtools ## Loading required package: usethis devtools::install_github(&quot;hhwagner1/LandGenCourse&quot;) ## Skipping install of &#39;LandGenCourse&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (97144337) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation library(LandGenCourse) b) How to use the R package LandGenCourse The package installs four Add-ins in RStudio. Each will provide you with some dropdown menu choices. Watch Course Video: opens a video resource from course Landscape Genetic Data Analysis with R. Start Tutorial: installs swirl course Landscape_Genetics_R_Course and prints instructions. Choose Worked Example: opens vignette file (.html, .Rmd, or .R) with a worked example from course Landscape Genetic Data Analysis with R. Open Cheat Sheet: opens selected R cheat sheet. c) Video instructions for beginners This video walks through the process of installing devtools, the course package, and using the RStudio Add-Ins.
