Book Structure This book has weekly chapters that correspond to course modules, with three parts: a) Getting Started Review of R Skills: check whether you need to build or brush up your R skills before starting the course: Basic R Programming: introduction to R objects and functions. Prerequisite. R Graphics: learn to create figures with base R and with ggplot2. Optional. b) Basic Topics These 8 weekly modules are streamlined to build the necessary R skills and brush up statistics knowledge. Best complete these in sequence. Each module has the following components: Video: introduces the R and stats topics Interactive Tutorial: swirl course to practice R programming Worked Example: worked example by the weekly experts from the ‘DGS Landscape Genetics’ course. Bonus Materials: some weeks include bonus vignettes with optional advanced topics. c) Advanced Topics These weekly modules build on the skills developed in Basic Topics. You may pick and choose from the Advanced Topics according to your interests. Each weekly modules contains: Worked Example: worked example by the weekly experts from the ‘DGS Landscape Genetics’ course.

Course R package LandGenCourse a) How to install (or update) if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) ## Loading required package: devtools ## Loading required package: usethis devtools::install_github(&quot;hhwagner1/LandGenCourse&quot;) ## Skipping install of &#39;LandGenCourse&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (7940614f) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation library(LandGenCourse) b) How to use the R package LandGenCourse The package installs four Add-ins in RStudio. Each will provide you with some dropdown menu choices. Watch Course Video: opens a video resource from course “Landscape Genetic Data Analysis with R.” Start Tutorial: installs swirl course “Landscape_Genetics_R_Course” and prints instructions. Choose Worked Example: opens vignette file (.html, .Rmd, or .R) with a worked example from course “Landscape Genetic Data Analysis with R.” Open Cheat Sheet: opens selected R cheat sheet. c) Video instructions for beginners This video walks through the process of installing devtools, the course package, and using the RStudio Add-Ins.
